This is the first post on my new blog, where I aim to share my passions and interests - Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, MMA, Jazz, Comics, Free Software, Linux, [fixed-gear bicycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-gear_bicycle) , Privacy. movies and series, as well as explore topics I'm not so keen on.

But you might ask yourself:

```Why create a blog in the year 2024? Wouldn't it be simpler and easier to use social networks to share your ideas?```

It seems to me that we are approaching a point where the internet seems to have an "owner" - someone who knows everything we do and how
we should do it. Social networks are great evidence of this. Creating this blog is a way of resisting this trend. Here, what
I share is available to everyone, without the need for authentication or algorithms to shape what you see.
